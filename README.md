A spin of my own genshin impact lyre bot, but based on some codes from https://github.com/Misaka17032/genshin-lyre-auto-play. 

This uses letter annotations in a .txt file instead of using midi conversion.

Rubia.txt is from 'Animuz - Anime Piano' on youtube, check his/her channel out!

My timing on the Rubia.txt may not be accurate, it is up to you to tinker with it!

^.^
Enjoy!
